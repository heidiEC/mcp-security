## Executive Summary

The supabase-mcp-server implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for managing Supabase projects and organizations. It provides a standardized interface for AI models and other clients to interact with Supabase resources. The server demonstrates good use of input validation through Zod schemas and leverages the security features of the underlying Supabase API. However, it relies heavily on the integrating application to provide critical security controls like authentication and rate limiting.

The server's main strengths lie in its use of type-safe schemas for input validation and its clear separation of concerns, delegating many security responsibilities to the Supabase API and the integrating application. Its primary weaknesses stem from the lack of built-in authentication, authorization, and rate limiting mechanisms, which could lead to security issues if not properly implemented during integration.

## Architecture Overview

The supabase-mcp-server is designed as a lightweight wrapper around the Supabase Management API, implementing the Model Context Protocol. It uses TypeScript and relies on the @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for core MCP functionality. The server defines a set of handlers for various Supabase operations, each using Zod schemas for request and response validation. Authentication is expected to be handled by the integrating application through the provision of a Supabase API key.

## Security Features Assessment

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Mechanisms**: Relies on Supabase API key provided by the integrating application
- **Token Management**: No built-in token management; assumes API key is securely handled by integrator
- **Authorization Model**: Inherits authorization from Supabase API permissions
- **Multi-tenancy**: Not directly implemented; depends on Supabase's multi-tenancy features
- **Strengths**: Leverages Supabase's robust authentication system
- **Weaknesses**: Lack of built-in authentication could lead to misuse if not properly integrated

### Data Protection
- **Data at Rest**: No local data storage; relies on Supabase's data protection measures
- **Data in Transit**: No explicit HTTPS enforcement; depends on deployment environment
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Minimal local handling of sensitive data; mostly passes through to Supabase API
- **Data Retention**: No specific policies implemented; defers to Supabase and integrating application
- **Strengths**: Minimal local data handling reduces risk
- **Weaknesses**: Lack of explicit transport security configuration guidance

### Input Validation & Processing
- **Request Validation**: Strong use of Zod schemas for input validation
- **Content Validation**: Input validation primarily focused on structure, not content
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling present, but could be more comprehensive
- **Strengths**: Consistent use of Zod schemas for type-safe validation
- **Weaknesses**: Limited content-based validation for potential malicious inputs

### Prompt Security
- **Injection Prevention**: No direct handling of prompts; relies on Supabase API security
- **Content Filtering**: Not implemented; defers to integrating application
- **Prompt Construction**: N/A - does not construct prompts
- **Strengths**: Minimal attack surface for prompt-related vulnerabilities
- **Weaknesses**: Lack of guidance for secure prompt handling in integration

### Infrastructure Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented; relies on integrating application or Supabase API limits
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Minimal built-in logging; defers to integrating application
- **Dependency Management**: Uses npm for dependency management; no obvious vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Configuration Security**: Relies on environment variables for configuration, which is generally secure
- **Strengths**: Use of environment variables for configuration
- **Weaknesses**: Lack of built-in rate limiting and comprehensive logging

## Vulnerabilities

| ID | Severity | Category | Description | Recommendation | Status |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| V1 | Medium | Authentication | No built-in authentication mechanism | Implement or clearly document required authentication integration | Open |
| V2 | Low | Infrastructure | Lack of built-in rate limiting | Implement rate limiting or provide clear integration guidance | Open |

## Deployment Recommendations
- **Minimum Requirements**: 
  - Secure management and rotation of Supabase API keys
  - Implementation of authentication mechanism in the integrating application
  - Deployment behind a secure API gateway or reverse proxy
- **Recommended Configuration**:
  - Use HTTPS for all communications
  - Implement strict CORS policies
  - Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Monitoring Guidance**:
  - Monitor for unusual API usage patterns
  - Track and alert on authentication failures
  - Regularly audit Supabase API key usage
- **Integration Considerations**:
  - Implement robust authentication before exposing the server
  - Consider adding an additional authorization layer
  - Implement rate limiting appropriate to the use case

## Code Quality Assessment
- **Code Structure**: Well-organized with clear separation of concerns
- **Documentation**: README provides basic usage information, but lacks detailed security guidance
- **Testing**: Limited evidence of security-focused testing
- **Maintainability**: Codebase is relatively small and focused, facilitating maintenance

## Certification Details
- **Certification Level**: Bronze
- **Justification**: The server implements basic input validation and leverages Supabase's security features. However, it lacks built-in authentication and several other security controls, relying heavily on proper integration for security.
- **Conditions**: Maintain current level of input validation and keep dependencies updated
- **Expiration**: 2024-05-28 (6 months from evaluation)
