# MCP Security Registry

A community-driven registry of security evaluations for Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementations.

## About This Project

The MCP Security Registry provides standardized security evaluations of MCP server implementations to help developers and organizations make informed decisions about which MCP servers to use in their applications. Our approach uses LLM-based analysis to provide comprehensive security assessments with actionable recommendations.

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). MCP servers act as intermediaries that manage context, handle retrieval, and facilitate communication between applications and LLMs.

### Why Security Matters

MCP servers often handle sensitive information and provide critical functionality for AI applications. Security vulnerabilities in MCP implementations can lead to data breaches, prompt injection attacks, and other security issues.

## Certification Process

Our certification process is designed to be transparent, thorough, and actionable:

1. **Repository Submission**: Developers submit their MCP server repository for evaluation
2. **LLM-Based Analysis**: Our system analyzes the repository using advanced LLM techniques
3. **Security Profile Generation**: A comprehensive security profile is created
4. **Certification Assignment**: The implementation receives a certification level based on its security posture
5. **Private Results Delivery**: Detailed results are delivered privately to the repository owner

## Certification Levels

MCP implementations can receive one of three certification levels:

- **Bronze**: Meets basic security requirements
- **Silver**: Implements recommended security practices
- **Gold**: Follows security best practices with no critical/high vulnerabilities

See our [Evaluation Criteria](evaluation-criterea.md) for detailed information on certification requirements.

## Request a Certification

To request a security evaluation for your MCP server implementation:

1. Ensure your repository is publicly accessible on GitHub
2. Submit your repository URL through our [certification request form](https://example.com/request-certification)
3. Receive detailed security analysis and certification results via email
4. Address any security issues identified
5. Request a re-evaluation to achieve a higher certification level (optional)

## Security Evaluation Template

Our security evaluations follow a standardized template to ensure comprehensive coverage of all security aspects. You can view the [evaluation template](evaluation-template.md) to understand what aspects of your implementation will be assessed.
