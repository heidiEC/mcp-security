# MCP Security Evaluation Criteria

This document defines the criteria used to evaluate the security of MCP server implementations. These criteria form the basis for certification levels and security scoring.

## Certification Levels

### Bronze Certification
- No critical vulnerabilities
- Authentication implemented
- Basic input validation
- HTTPS/TLS implemented
- No hardcoded secrets
- Basic rate limiting

### Silver Certification
All Bronze requirements, plus:
- No high vulnerabilities
- Strong authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT)
- Comprehensive input validation
- Proper error handling
- Prompt injection protections
- Comprehensive rate limiting
- Secure logging practices
- Dependency management

### Gold Certification
All Silver requirements, plus:
- No medium vulnerabilities
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Role-based access control
- Data encryption at rest
- Advanced prompt security measures
- Tenant isolation
- Comprehensive security documentation
- Security testing in CI/CD
- Vulnerability disclosure policy

## Scoring Criteria

Each category is scored on a scale of 1-10, with the following general guidelines:

- **1-2**: Severe deficiencies, multiple critical issues
- **3-4**: Significant weaknesses, high-risk vulnerabilities
- **5-6**: Basic implementation with some weaknesses
- **7-8**: Good implementation with minor issues
- **9-10**: Excellent implementation following best practices

## Detailed Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### Authentication Mechanisms
- **Basic (1-4)**: Simple API key or basic auth
- **Good (5-7)**: Token-based auth with proper expiration
- **Excellent (8-10)**: OAuth/OIDC, MFA support, secure token management

#### Authorization Model
- **Basic (1-4)**: All-or-nothing access
- **Good (5-7)**: Simple role-based permissions
- **Excellent (8-10)**: Fine-grained permissions, attribute-based access control

#### Multi-tenancy
- **Basic (1-4)**: Limited or no tenant isolation
- **Good (5-7)**: Logical separation between tenants
- **Excellent (8-10)**: Complete tenant isolation with no data leakage

### 2. Data Protection

#### Data at Rest
- **Basic (1-4)**: Unencrypted storage
- **Good (5-7)**: Basic encryption
- **Excellent (8-10)**: Strong encryption with proper key management

#### Data in Transit
- **Basic (1-4)**: HTTP support with optional HTTPS
- **Good (5-7)**: HTTPS required with modern TLS
- **Excellent (8-10)**: HTTPS with HSTS, proper cert management, modern cipher suites

#### Sensitive Data Handling
- **Basic (1-4)**: No special handling for sensitive data
- **Good (5-7)**: Some protection for sensitive fields
- **Excellent (8-10)**: Comprehensive PII protection, data minimization

### 3. Input Validation & Processing

#### Request Validation
- **Basic (1-4)**: Minimal or inconsistent validation
- **Good (5-7)**: Validation on most endpoints
- **Excellent (8-10)**: Comprehensive schema validation on all inputs

#### Error Handling
- **Basic (1-4)**: Errors may expose sensitive information
- **Good (5-7)**: Sanitized error messages
- **Excellent (8-10)**: Structured error handling with no information leakage

### 4. Prompt Security

#### Injection Prevention
- **Basic (1-4)**: Limited or no protection against prompt injection
- **Good (5-7)**: Basic sanitization of user inputs in prompts
- **Excellent (8-10)**: Comprehensive prompt injection protections, role separation

#### Content Filtering
- **Basic (1-4)**: No content filtering
- **Good (5-7)**: Basic inappropriate content detection
- **Excellent (8-10)**: Advanced content filtering with customizable policies

### 5. Infrastructure Security

#### Rate Limiting
- **Basic (1-4)**: Basic or global rate limits
- **Good (5-7)**: Per-user/per-endpoint rate limiting
- **Excellent (8-10)**: Sophisticated rate limiting with adaptive throttling

#### Logging & Monitoring
- **Basic (1-4)**: Basic operational logging
- **Good (5-7)**: Security event logging
- **Excellent (8-10)**: Comprehensive security logging, alerting, audit trails

#### Dependency Management
- **Basic (1-4)**: Outdated or vulnerable dependencies
- **Good (5-7)**: Regular updates, vulnerability scanning
- **Excellent (8-10)**: Automated dependency updates, SBOMs, supply chain security

## Vulnerability Severity Definitions

### Critical
- Authentication bypass
- Remote code execution
- Arbitrary data access across tenants
- Exposure of authentication credentials

### High
- Sensitive data exposure
- Server-side request forgery
- Significant prompt injection vulnerabilities
- Authorization bypass within a tenant

### Medium
- Cross-site scripting
- Insecure direct object references
- Insufficient rate limiting
- Weak authentication mechanisms

### Low
- Information disclosure of non-sensitive data
- Missing security headers
- Suboptimal security configurations
- Minor information leakage in error messages
